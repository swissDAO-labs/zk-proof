# ZK Proof for AI Art Generation

## Overview

This project implements a zero-knowledge proof (zk proof) system for verifying that art generated by AI belongs to a specific collection while preserving the privacy of the artist's prompt.

### Objective
The main objective of this system is to prove that the generated art was created using a prompt template provided by the artist.

### Importance of Preserving the Privacy of the Artist's Prompt

The confidentiality of the artist's prompt is paramount for several reasons:

1. **Protecting Artistic Integrity:** By keeping the prompt confidential, the integrity of the art collection is preserved. If the prompt were revealed, individuals could recreate similar art pieces, diluting the uniqueness and authenticity of the collection.
2. **Ensuring Exclusivity:** Art collections often hold significant value due to their exclusivity. If the artist's prompt were publicly known, it could diminish the exclusivity of the collection, impacting its desirability and value in the art market.
3. **Preventing Unauthorized Replication:** Disclosure of the prompt could lead to unauthorized replication of the art pieces. This not only undermines the artist's creative process but also raises concerns about plagiarism and intellectual property infringement.
4. **Maintaining Artistic Vision:** Artists rely on their prompts to convey their unique artistic vision and style. By safeguarding the confidentiality of the prompt, artists can maintain control over how their art is perceived and ensure that it aligns with their intended message and aesthetic.

### How it Works
1. **Public Input (User Prompt):** Users provide a public input, which serves as the prompt for the AI art generation. This input is recorded on-chain in a transaction and is limited in scope, allowing for some customization by the user.
2. **Private Input (Artist's Contribution):** The artist provides a private piece of data, which is part of the prompt used in the generation process. This remains confidential.
3. **Proof Generation:** The system generates a zk proof demonstrating that the generated art was indeed produced using the combination of the public input (user prompt) and the private input (artist's contribution).
4. **Verification:** Users can verify the proof to confirm that the art was generated as part of the specified collection without revealing the private details of the artist's contribution.
